# keep in mind the print is another function like the ones u're used to
#double quotes
print("hello world")
#single quote cant be used with a word like we're going u need to encase in a double quote
print('this is a print function')
#thats an escape character
print('we\'re going to the store')

#concatenation u cant concatenate with a number
print('hi '+'there')
#to fix it
print('hi '+str(5))
print(int('8') +5)
print(float('5.4')+6)
